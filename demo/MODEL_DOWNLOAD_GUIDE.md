## Download Locations

By default, models are downloaded to the `./models/` directory:
- `./models/VibeVoice-1.5B/` for the 1.5B model
- `./models/VibeVoice-7B-Preview/` for the 7B model

You can customize the download location using the "Download Path" field. The demo automatically scans this directory and makes downloaded models available in the dropdown selector.

## Custom Voice Upload

The demo supports uploading your own voice samples to create personalized speakers:

### **Upload Process:**
1. Click on "ðŸŽ¤ Upload Custom Voices" accordion in the Speaker Selection section
2. Upload an audio file (WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC)
3. Enter a unique voice name (e.g., "My-Voice" or "John-Narrator")
4. Click "âž• Add Custom Voice"
5. The custom voice will automatically appear in speaker dropdowns

### **Voice Requirements:**
- **Length**: 3-30 seconds recommended (1-60 seconds supported)
- **Quality**: Clear speech with minimal background noise
- **Content**: Natural speaking voice works best
- **Format**: Automatic conversion to 24kHz WAV for optimal compatibility

### **File Storage:**
- Custom voices are saved to `demo/voices/` directory
- Files are prefixed with "custom-" to distinguish from built-in voices
- Audio is automatically normalized and converted to the required format

## Troubleshooting

- **Network Issues**: Download will automatically retry and resume if interrupted
- **Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient disk space (1.5B model: ~5-6GB, 7B model: ~18-20GB)
- **Permissions**: Make sure you have write permissions to the download directory
- **HuggingFace Authentication**: Some models may require HuggingFace login (use `huggingface-cli login`)
